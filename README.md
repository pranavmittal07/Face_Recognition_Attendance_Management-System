# Face_Recognition_Attendance_Management_System

Implementation
1. Registration Functionality
•	Description: The registration functionality involves capturing images of students and storing them as known faces for face recognition during attendance marking.
•	Technologies Used:
•	OpenCV (cv2): Capturing images from the camera for registration.
•	face_recognition Library: Recognizing faces and encoding them for storage.
•	Tkinter: Creating the registration GUI for user interaction.
•	Workflow:
1.	Capture images of students using OpenCV.
2.	Utilize the face_recognition library to recognize faces and encode them.
3.	Store the encoded face data along with student information for future recognition during attendance marking.
2. Mark Attendance Functionality
•	Description: The mark attendance functionality marks student attendance based on recognized faces and course details provided by the user.
•	Technologies Used:
•	OpenCV (cv2): Capturing images from the camera for attendance marking.
•	face_recognition Library: Recognizing faces and comparing them with known faces for attendance.
•	Tkinter: Creating the attendance marking GUI for user interaction.
•	Pandas, OpenPyXL: Handling Excel files to store attendance data.
•	Workflow:
1.	Capture images of students using OpenCV during class sessions.
2.	Recognize faces using the face_recognition library and compare them with known faces.
3.	Obtain course details and teacher's name from the user using the Tkinter GUI.
4.	Mark attendance in Excel files based on recognized faces and user input for course details.
3. Analysis Functionality
•	Description: The analysis functionality allows users to load attendance data and analyze it to visualize attendance trends.
•	Technologies Used:
•	Tkinter: Creating the analysis GUI for user interaction.
•	Pandas, Matplotlib: Analyzing data and visualizing attendance trends through graphs.
•	PIL (Pillow): Processing images for display within the GUI.
•	Workflow:
1.	Load attendance data from Excel files using Pandas.
2.	Analyze attendance counts using Pandas to calculate attendance trends.
3.	Generate bar graphs using Matplotlib to visualize attendance data.
4.	Embed Matplotlib plots within the Tkinter GUI for interactive data visualization.
